<img src="./mate-stable-coin-img.png" alt="MATE Stablecoin" width="200"/>

Note: This project is a practice exercise designed to explore and experiment with various Solidity concepts learned through the [Updraft Cyfrin](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses).

Developed a smart contract to implement a stable coin with the following characteristics:
- Anchored to USD ðŸ’µ (and not Argentine peso ðŸ§‰).
- Algorithmic.
- Collateral: wETH and wBTC.
- Users need to be 200% overcollateralized.
- Liquidators get 10% bonus.
- Known issues: 
   - If collateral/USD prices drops quickly, engine wouldn't be able to pay liquidators and system breaks.
   - If Chainlink network is down, the system is unusable.
